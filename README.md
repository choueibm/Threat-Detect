# Threat-Detect
This is an application that includes a graphical user interface. This application allows for the user to input a address in the US, a radius (in Km), and the respective state that the given address resides in. Once the input has been passed, the program converts the address into it's respective longitude and latitude coordinates. The program was enabled to read from a excel sheet containing information of every gun violence incident (and the exact date/location where they occurred) that took place from 2013-2018. This excel sheet was provided through a government official website, hence the data is accurate. The program then displays all the gun violence incidents within the radius (the address the user inputs is the middle point), and the number of people injured and total fatalities.
